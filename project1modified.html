            <span style="font-size:x-large;background-color:rgb(250, 238, 135)">Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam</span>, was born in Rameswaram of Madras Presidency on 15th October 1931 to a poor Tamil Muslim family. He lived 
            with his family in the temple city of Tamilnadu, Rameswaram, where his father, Jainulabdeen, had a boat and was an imam of a local
             mosque. At the same time, his mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife. Kalam had four brothers and one sister in his family, from which
              he was the youngest. Kalam's ancestors were wealthy traders and landowners and had vast land and property tracts. But with time,
               their business of ferrying pilgrims and trading groceries suffered huge losses due to the Pamban Bridge's opening. As a result, 
               Kalam's family had become inadequate and struggled hard to make a living. At a tender age, Kalam had to sell newspapers
                to supplement his family income.
